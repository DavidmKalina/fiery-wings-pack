# Server resource pack

The resource pack for my Minecraft server (26.3, pack format 97). The server's ResourcePack plugin sends players the
link to `resource-pack.zip` when they join, so there's nothing to install by hand.

`resource-pack.zip` is built from the `pack/` folders of the server's plugins by `resource-pack/tools/build_pack.py`;
don't edit it by hand. What's in it:

- `assets/fierywings/`: the fiery elytra wings worn with a Fiery Winged Chestplate (FieryWings plugin)
- `assets/ghastbreath/`: a happy ghast that has had dragon's breath looks like a regular ghast, with or without a
  harness (GhastBreath plugin)
- `assets/inventory/` and `assets/minecraft/items/iron_chain.json`: two crossed chains on /tidy auto's Priority frames
  (an iron chain with custom model data `tidy_priority`; ordinary chains look as usual)
- `assets/minecraft/textures/`, `assets/minecraft/lang/`: beetroots look like bananas (green while growing, yellow
  when ripe) and are called Banana, Banana Seeds and Bananas; beetroot soup is "Cumpot", a cheesecake gone wrong
- `assets/ctweaks/`: models for the extra slabs and stairs of the CraftingTweaks plugin

`fiery-wings.zip` is the old pack from before everything moved into one; it goes once the server has switched over.
